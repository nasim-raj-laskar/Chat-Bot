# Chatbot Application

This project features a chatbot application built using Python and PyTorch. The chatbot interacts with users based on predefined intents and provides responses using a trained neural network model.

## Project Structure

- `intents.json`: Contains various user intents and their corresponding responses.
- `nltk_util.py`: Utility functions for text preprocessing, including tokenization and stemming.
- `train.py`: Script for training the neural network model.
- `model.py`: Defines the architecture of the neural network.
- `chat.py`: Handles chatbot responses based on user input.
- `app.py`: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the chatbot.
